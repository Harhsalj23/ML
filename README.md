# Machine Learning
- In this github repo Machine learning algorithms have been applied on datasets.

- Algorithms are used for finding outliers with the help of bode plot and IQR (Inter Quartile Range) along with various graphs are plotted like histogram, kdeplot.

- Further in this algorithms for data preprocesing is applied to find null values in dataset or in column, replacing null values with median or mean as required and so on.

- Also in this, algorithms for various feature engineering such as robust scaling, standardization, feature transformation is also applied.

- Along with this all, algorithms for encoding, linear regression models are there.
